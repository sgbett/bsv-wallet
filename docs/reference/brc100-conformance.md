# BRC-100 conformance register

A living register of every BRC-100 concept and our stance on it. Companion to [`core-vs-conformance.md`](core-vs-conformance.md), which states the load-bearing principle this register applies. The register is the per-element classification; the principle is what governs each row.

Stance values:

- **Implemented (core)** — the concept maps to a wallet operation that lives in the Engine/Store. Native first-class behaviour.
- **Boundary-only** — the spec parameter or shape is accepted at `BSV::Wallet::BRC100`, translated or stubbed, and not propagated into the Engine.
- **Diverged** — we implement the concept but with semantics tuned to our single-tenant deployment. Spec contract honoured at the wire; internal behaviour differs from the spec's presumed reference model.
- **Deferred** — accepted at the boundary as a stub or no-op; full machinery not built. The path to implementation, if/when it becomes load-bearing, is recorded.
- **Amputated** — absent from the wallet entirely. The concept has no operational equivalent in our deployment model.

This document is intended to be edited as positions move between categories. A concept that starts deferred and is later built moves to implemented or boundary-only with the original entry preserved in the change log at the bottom.

## Cryptographic operations

| BRC-100 method | Engine primitive | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `encrypt` / `decrypt` | `engine.encrypt` / `engine.decrypt` | Implemented (core) | Over `@key_deriver` (AES-GCM symmetric, BRC-2). |
| `createHmac` / `verifyHmac` | `engine.create_hmac` / `engine.verify_hmac` | Implemented (core) | Over `@key_deriver` (BRC-56). |
| `createSignature` / `verifySignature` | `engine.create_signature` / `engine.verify_signature` | Implemented (core) | Over `@key_deriver` (BRC-3). |

These are the indivisible-verb 1:1 primitives ratified by ADR-026. Conformance wraps each in BRC-100 hash-vocabulary shape; the Engine speaks wallet vocab.

## Public keys and identity

| BRC-100 method / param | Engine primitive | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getPublicKey` | `engine.get_public_key` | Implemented (core) | Identity-shaped pubkeys returned as hex (ADR-008); derived pubkeys returned as binary. |
| `protocolID` / `keyID` | — (kwargs) | Implemented (core) | BRC-43 derivation parameters. Pass through to `@key_deriver`. |
| `counterparty` (self / anyone / hex) | — (kwarg) | Implemented (core) | BRC-43 counterparty rules. Identity-shaped pubkey hex carve-out preserves the spec's wire form. |
| `forSelf` | — (kwarg) | Implemented (core) | Self-derivation flag. |
| `privileged` / `privilegedReason` | — (kwarg) | Deferred | Accepted at the boundary, no privilege escalation machinery (no permission UI to escalate through). When BRC-116 lands, becomes a permission check. |

## Certificates

| BRC-100 method | Engine primitive | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `acquireCertificate` | `engine.acquire_certificate` | Implemented (core) | `certificates` / `certificate_fields` tables canonical (BRC-52 interchange in hex per ADR-008's identity-pubkey carve-out rationale). |
| `listCertificates` | `engine.list_certificates` | Implemented (core) | Same. |
| `proveCertificate` | `engine.prove_certificate` | Implemented (core) | Selective field disclosure via BRC-52. |
| `relinquishCertificate` | `engine.relinquish_certificate` | Implemented (core) | Removes certificate from wallet's tracked set. |
| `discoverByIdentityKey` | `engine.discover_by_identity_key` | Implemented (core) | Remote certificate discovery via configured network services. |
| `discoverByAttributes` | `engine.discover_by_attributes` | Implemented (core) | Same. |

## Key linkage revelation

| BRC-100 method | Engine primitive | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `revealCounterpartyKeyLinkage` | `engine.reveal_counterparty_key_linkage` | Implemented (core) | BRC-69 method 1, BRC-72 protection. |
| `revealSpecificKeyLinkage` | `engine.reveal_specific_key_linkage` | Implemented (core) | BRC-69 method 2, BRC-72 protection. Includes BRC-97 proof-type for future ZKP schemes. |

## Action lifecycle

| BRC-100 method | Engine primitive | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `createAction` | **`engine.build_action`** | Implemented (core) | Naming divergence — see ["Engine primitive naming"](#engine-primitive-naming) below. Funding strategy, fee model, change generation (ADR-013). Returns `signableTransaction` for deferred-sign path (ADR-024 forward direction). |
| `signAction` | `engine.sign_action` | Implemented (core) | Spec-aligned. |
| `internalizeAction` | **`engine.import_beef`** | Implemented (core) | Naming divergence — see below. Both `wallet payment` (BRC-29) and `basket insertion` protocols. |
| `abortAction` | `engine.abort_action` | Implemented (core) | Failure-bounded delete of unpromoted outputs (ADR-011 delete). |
| `listActions` | `engine.list_actions` | Implemented (core) | Status derived from structural state per principle-of-state. |
| `listOutputs` | **`engine.spendable_outputs`** | Implemented (core), with [HLR #434 nil-basket affordance](#listoutputs-basket-nil-affordance-hlr-434) | Naming divergence — see below. Basket-scoped query at the wrapper; Engine primitive accepts basket-optional with `nil` = unbasketed. The wrapper *also* accepts `basket: nil` as an intentional divergence to surface the wallet's change pool to BRC-100 callers — see the [linked section](#listoutputs-basket-nil-affordance-hlr-434). |
| `relinquishOutput` | `engine.relinquish_output` | Implemented (core) | Removes from `spendable`; output row preserved. |

### Engine primitive naming

The default is: **Engine primitive == the Ruby-idiomatic snake_case of the BRC-100 camelCase spec name** — straightforward snake_case for verb-shaped names (`signAction` → `sign_action`, `getPublicKey` → `get_public_key`), and Ruby's predicate convention for `is_*`-shaped booleans (`isAuthenticated` → `authenticated?`, per the Authentication section below). 25 of the 28 primitives follow this rule directly. The three exceptions all share one rationale:

> **When the BRC-100 method name names a procedural verb or a metaphor, and the wallet's actual operation has a more direct name, the Engine primitive takes the direct name.**

The three divergences:

| BRC-100 | Engine | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `createAction` | `build_action` | "build" names what the wallet does — assemble a transaction with funding, fees, change. "create" is BRC-100 metaphor for "the action lifecycle entry point". |
| `internalizeAction` | `import_beef` | "import_beef" names the concrete operation — take a BEEF envelope, incorporate its outputs into the wallet. "internalize" is BRC-100 metaphor for "take this thing and consider it mine". |
| `listOutputs` | `spendable_outputs` | "spendable_outputs" IS the query — the UTXO set, optionally basket-filtered. "list" is BRC-100 procedural verb-stacking that has no parallel meaning in the wallet's vocabulary. |

The conformance layer (`BSV::Wallet::BRC100`) wraps each Engine primitive under the BRC-100 spec name and shape. Callers using BRC-100 see no divergence; consumers using Engine primitives directly (Engine::Batch, future #223 HTTP wrapper, future Engine::Transmission) see the wallet's own language.

This is ADR-026's "Engine speaks wallet vocab, BRC-100 wraps" principle applied at the *method-name* axis specifically — and ADR-026's primitive-surface decisions are the foundation; this register is the per-method record over time. The three divergences are recorded here, not in ADR-026, because they may grow or contract over time and ADRs are point-in-time decisions.

### Action lifecycle parameters

| Parameter | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `inputs` / `outputs` | Implemented (core) | Action construction. |
| `inputBEEF` | Implemented (core) | Ancestry import via `Engine::BeefImporter`. |
| `description` | Implemented (core) | `actions.description` column. |
| `labels` (on action) | Implemented (core) | `tx_labels` / `tx_labels_map` tables. |
| `tags` (on output) | Implemented (core) | `output_tags` / `output_tags_map` tables. |
| `basket` (per output) | Diverged | See "Basket semantics" below. |
| `customInstructions` (per output) | Implemented (core) | Column on `outputs`. |
| `outputDescription` (per output) | Implemented (core) | Column on `outputs`. |
| `knownTxids` | Implemented (core) | Ancestry import optimisation; the parameter name `txids` is BRC-100 spec vocabulary at the boundary, values are wire-order wtxids internally. |
| `noSend` / `sendWith` | Deferred | Engine decomposition precondition complete (ADR-024); restoration tracked by #192. The lifecycle exists structurally; the deferred-send orchestration on top is the missing piece. |
| `acceptDelayedBroadcast` | Implemented (core) | Maps to declarative broadcast intent (ADR-019). |
| `randomizeOutputs` | Implemented (core) | Boundary shuffle before signing. |
| `include` (`'locking scripts'` / `'entire transactions'`) | Implemented (core) | Result shape control for `listOutputs`. |
| `includeCustomInstructions` / `includeTags` / `includeLabels` | Implemented (core) | Result shape control flags. |

### Basket semantics — the divergence

The spec contract says: outputs created without `basket` are not surfaced by `listOutputs`. We honour this at the wire. Internally, however, every output is recorded in the `outputs` table; basket membership (via the `output_baskets` JOIN, not as a column on `outputs`) is a categorisation axis, not a tenancy axis. Multi-tenant wallets in the reference implementation use `basket` as a per-app sandbox key (with `userId` as the per-user partition). We have neither. For us, basket is what the application chose to name its outputs by, and the "untracked" behaviour is enforced as a query-time filter at the conformance layer, not as an absence in the storage layer.

This is a divergence in internal semantics with full external conformance.

### Change routing and the "disappearing basket"

BRC-100 is silent on where change should land after a `createAction` spend. The spec says `listOutputs` is basket-scoped and forbids the basket name `'default'`, but it doesn't prescribe where the wallet puts change, nor how an application should reason about its per-basket balance after a spend cycle.

The practical consequence is the **"disappearing basket"** failure:

> An application calls `listOutputs(basket: 'X')` → sees 1 BSV. It spends 20m sats via `createAction`. The wallet selects the 1 BSV input, sends 20m, generates ~80m sats of change. Afterwards, `listOutputs(basket: 'X')` returns nothing — the UTXO was spent. The 80m sats of change went... where?

Neither implementation we know of routes change back to the source basket. Both choose a single "pool" reading instead:

| | wallet-toolbox | this wallet |
|---|---|---|
| Change destination | basket literally named `'default'` | unbasketed (no `output_baskets` row) |
| App-visible via | `listOutputs(basket: 'default')` | `listOutputs(basket: nil)` — HLR #434 |
| Auto-fund draws from | `'default'` basket only | unbasketed only — HLR #435 |
| App-basketed UTXOs protected from auto-fund | yes | yes |
| Spec compliance of the visibility mechanism | uses a spec-banned name | uses a Ruby-side type quirk; TS-conformant callers can't trigger |

Functionally these are the same shape: a single wallet-managed pool, auto-funded from itself, queryable by applications under a known identifier. Wallet-toolbox's identifier (`'default'`) is the spec-banned name; ours (`nil`) is a Ruby-only affordance the spec doesn't recognise. Different identifiers, same trade-off.

**Where the gap lives.** Both wallets end up here because BRC-100 doesn't decide. The spec could specify:

- A `changeBasket` parameter on `createAction` (explicit caller control), or
- Default change-to-source-basket routing (preserves the per-basket view), or
- That change is intentionally invisible to `listOutputs` and apps reconstruct via `listActions` (strict reading).

None of these is documented. Until upstream picks one, every BRC-100 wallet picks a workaround and the application-facing behaviour is implementation-defined. Our `basket: nil` affordance and wallet-toolbox's `'default'` basket are equivalent responses to the same silence.

**Not our problem to fix unilaterally.** Routing change back to source baskets, or adding a `changeBasket` parameter to `createAction`, would create a third behaviour incompatible with the ambient (if unstated) convention. We're tracking this as a known UX failure shared with wallet-toolbox; the upstream resolution will retire both wallets' workarounds together. The `engine.build_action` primitive already accepts a `change_basket:` kwarg internally (used by `Engine#import_utxo` per HLR #436) — when upstream lands a spec for application-driven change routing, the plumbing to expose it on the conformance surface is already in place.

### `listOutputs basket: nil` affordance (HLR #434)

A second, more pointed divergence on this method: **`BSV::Wallet::BRC100#list_outputs` accepts `basket: nil` as a Ruby-side affordance** that routes to `engine.spendable_outputs(basket: nil)` — i.e. returns the wallet's unbasketed pool, which is where change outputs land in our model.

The spec gap that motivates this: BRC-100 requires `basket` on `listOutputs` and bans `'default'` as a basket name. Wallet-toolbox sidesteps the gap by routing change to a basket literally named `'default'` and surfacing it via `listOutputs(basket: 'default')` — undocumented behaviour that contradicts the spec's ban on the name. We don't do that — our change is genuinely unbasketed. The cost is that spec-conformant BRC-100 callers have no way to see change or the wallet's residual pool via `listOutputs` at all (it's visible via `listActions` and the `createAction` response, but not via the per-basket query). For a Ruby client that knows our internals, `basket: nil` closes this gap pragmatically.

**Invisible to TypeScript-conformant callers.** The TS type `BasketStringUnder300Characters` is non-nullable, so a TypeScript client constructing `listOutputs({ basket: null })` fails at type-check before reaching the wallet. The affordance affects only Ruby-side callers.

**Acceptance / behaviour:**

- `brc100.list_outputs(basket: nil)` returns the unbasketed spendable set, matching `engine.spendable_outputs(basket: nil)`.
- `brc100.list_outputs(basket: '')` and `brc100.list_outputs(basket: '   ')` continue to raise `ArgumentError` — only literal `nil` is the affordance.
- Return shape matches the BRC-100 hash: `{ total_outputs:, outputs: }`.

**Temporary by design.** The cleaner fix is upstream: BRC-100 deciding either (a) how change should be visible (per-basket return, named change basket, a new method, etc.) or (b) that it's correctly invisible and apps must track via `createAction` responses + `listActions`. Until upstream settles, this affordance lets the wallet remain usable for BRC-100 callers. **When upstream lands real semantics, remove this affordance.** The risk worth naming: the affordance solves immediate problems well enough that pressure to push upstream for proper resolution can ebb. The HLR captures this so future-us reads it back.

## Chain queries

| BRC-100 method | Engine primitive | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `getHeight` | `engine.get_height` | Implemented (core) | Via configured chain tracker (ADR-015 pivot). |
| `getHeaderForHeight` | `engine.get_header_for_height` | Implemented (core) | Same. |
| `getNetwork` | `engine.get_network` | Implemented (core) | `'mainnet'` / `'testnet'` from wallet configuration. |
| `getVersion` | `engine.get_version` | Implemented (core) | Wallet version reporting. |

## Authentication

| BRC-100 method | Engine primitive | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `isAuthenticated` | `engine.authenticated?` | Implemented (core), trivially | Ruby predicate convention (`?`-suffixed boolean) rather than `is_*` naming. Always `true` for a constructed Engine — having the WIF is being authenticated. |
| `waitForAuthentication` | `engine.wait_for_authentication` | Implemented (core), trivially | Returns immediately. The BRC-100 reference assumes an authentication step where the wallet is unlocked by user action; we have no lock state, so the wait is a no-op. |

The spec's authentication model presupposes a lock-screen / unlock UI. We replace it with WIF-at-construction: if you constructed the Engine, you authenticated. The `is_authenticated` → `authenticated?` shift is Ruby predicate idiom, not a vocabulary divergence — `is_` prefixes are foreign to Ruby in the same way that `_t` type suffixes are foreign to C++.

## Cross-cutting parameters

| Parameter | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `originator` | Boundary-only | Accepted on every BRC-100 method, dropped at the boundary. Forward direction: DBAP-style permission tokens in admin baskets when implemented (originator ADR). |
| `seekPermission` | Boundary-only | Accepted, no-op'd. We have no permission UI to seek from. Will become meaningful when BRC-116 lands. |
| `OriginatorDomainNameString` validation | Boundary-only | Format validation at the conformance layer (FQDN shape) where present; no behavioural use. |
| Hash-vocabulary return shapes (`{ txid:, tx: }` etc.) | Boundary-only | Conformance translates wallet vocab returns into BRC-100 hash shapes. ADR-026 codifies this. |
| Spec-shape input validation | Partially implemented (HLR #428 — baskets); BRC-98 protocol IDs / labels / tags tracked | Basket-name validation landed under HLR #428: the four BRC-100 entry points (`createAction`, `internalizeAction`, `listOutputs`, `relinquishOutput`) normalise on ingress (trim + lowercase + frozen) and reject names that violate the 8 BRC-100 §"Rules for Basket Names" rules at the conformance layer, with a matching DB CHECK on `baskets.name`. Protocol IDs (BRC-98), labels, and tags follow the same family of rules and remain tracked. Engine continues to assume valid input (the conformance layer is responsible for spec-shape). |
| `userId` (implied) | Amputated | No `users` table, no `user_id` column anywhere. Identity is the WIF (ADR-007). Forward direction: per-user databases (per-user-databases ADR). |

## Reserved names

BRC-100 reserves several name patterns. We enforce them at the conformance layer AND at the schema floor (principle-of-state: even if the conformance layer is bypassed by an Engine-direct or raw-store path, the DB CHECK rejects the write). Basket-name reservation landed under HLR #428 (boundary validator at `BSV::Wallet::BRC100` + matching CHECK on `baskets.name`); the protocol-ID rows below remain tracked (same family of rules, not yet wired).

The `admin` reservation is BRC-100 §"Rules for Basket Names" (the first-cut HLR misattributed it to BRC-99; BRC-99 specifies only the `p ` rule). It is load-bearing for ADR-029's DBAP/DPACP/DCAP/DSAP direction — letting `admin foo` through today would create a migration cost when the wallet's own permission-token baskets (`admin basket-access`, etc.) land.

| Pattern | Concern | Stance |
|---|---|---|
| Basket names starting with `admin` (BRC-100) | Reserved for wallet-internal use (e.g. wallet-toolbox uses `admin basket-access` for DBAP tokens). | **Implemented (boundary + DB)** — `BSV::Wallet::BRC100` rejects; `baskets.name_not_admin` CHECK rejects. Reserved for future originator/DBAP work (ADR-029). |
| Basket name `default` | Historically used by some wallets for internal operations. | **Implemented (boundary + DB)** — `BSV::Wallet::BRC100` rejects; `baskets.name_not_default` CHECK rejects. |
| Basket names starting with `p ` (BRC-99) | Reserved for future specially-permissioned baskets. | **Implemented (boundary + DB)** — `BSV::Wallet::BRC100` rejects; `baskets.name_not_p_prefix` CHECK rejects. |
| Basket names trailing ` basket` | Redundant suffix. | **Implemented (boundary + DB)** — `BSV::Wallet::BRC100` rejects; `baskets.name_not_basket` CHECK rejects. |
| Protocol IDs starting with `admin` (BRC-98) | Reserved for wallet-internal use. | Boundary-only — reject from the public API. (Same-family work, not yet wired — tracked.) |
| Protocol IDs starting with `p ` (BRC-98) | Reserved for future specially-permissioned protocols. | Boundary-only — reject from the public API. (Same-family work, not yet wired — tracked.) |
| Protocol IDs trailing ` protocol` | Redundant suffix. | Boundary-only — reject from the public API. (Same-family work, not yet wired — tracked.) |

Implementation landed: HLR #428 (boundary validator + `baskets.name` CHECK). Protocol IDs / labels / tags follow the same family of rules; tracked separately for the next sub-HLR.

### Basket length limit — landed at 300; upstream inconsistency tracked

BRC-100 §"Rules for Basket Names" says basket names must be ≤ **400 characters**. The TS type `BasketStringUnder300Characters` used on every basket-bearing field says ≤ **300 characters**. The two are in tension within the spec itself.

We adopt **300** as the binding limit, on the grounds that the TS type is what conformant callers validate their inputs against. HLR #428 landed this position in code (`BSV::Wallet::BRC100::BASKET_NAME_MAX = 300` plus the `baskets.name_length` CHECK `BETWEEN 5 AND 300`). A follow-up tracking issue against `bitcoin-sv/BRCs` surfaces the 300-vs-400 inconsistency upstream so the next spec revision can pick one.

## Permission machinery (BRC-116)

| Concept | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Per-originator basket access (DBAP) | Deferred | Direction recorded in the originator ADR: PushDrop tokens in an `admin basket-access` basket, mirroring wallet-toolbox. |
| Per-originator protocol access (DPACP) | Deferred | Same mechanism, `admin protocol-permission` basket. |
| Per-originator certificate access (DCAP) | Deferred | Same mechanism, `admin certificate-access` basket. |
| Per-originator spending authorisation (DSAP) | Deferred | Same mechanism, `admin spending-authorization` basket. |
| Grouped permission requests | Deferred | Surface added when DBAP lands. |
| Counterparty trust grants | Deferred | Surface added when DBAP lands. |
| `onXxxRequested` callbacks | Amputated | No permission UI. If a host UI ever wraps the wallet, it owns its own prompting; the wallet does not export callback hooks. |

## Application identity model

| Concept | Stance | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App discovery / `manifest.json` interaction | Amputated | No multi-app surface. |
| Per-origin sandboxing | Amputated | No application boundary inside the wallet; the consumer is whoever holds the WIF. |
| Per-origin storage namespace | Amputated | One wallet's outputs are one wallet's outputs. No per-origin partition. |
| `displayOriginator` (UI hint) | Amputated | No UI. |

## How to read this register

When a BRC-100-shaped change arrives — a new method call from a consumer, a parameter we hadn't seen, a return shape mismatch — find the entry. If absent, add one. The register is the authoritative answer to "do we handle this, and how?" so that we don't re-derive the rationale every time it comes up.

When a deferred concept becomes load-bearing, move the entry to its new stance, link the implementation issue/ADR, and preserve the original rationale in a `<details>` block under the entry. This document is the trail of decisions, not a one-shot snapshot.

## Change log

- *2026-06-24* — Initial register. All categorisations recorded against the wallet's state at this date; subsequent moves between stances will be logged here.
- *2026-06-24* — Added "Engine primitive" column to the method tables. Recorded the three current name divergences (`createAction` → `build_action`, `internalizeAction` → `import_beef`, `listOutputs` → `spendable_outputs`) and the naming policy under which future divergences are evaluated. Same-day with the initial register because the divergences and the principle that explains them are co-discovered. (PRs #429 and #430 landed the prerequisite Engine surface changes — the `spendable_outputs` rename and `seek_permission:` residue removal respectively.)
- *2026-06-25* — Added the `listOutputs` `basket: nil` affordance (HLR #434) as an explicit, named divergence: BRC100 wrapper accepts `nil` and routes to `engine.spendable_outputs(basket: nil)`, surfacing the wallet's unbasketed pool (including change) to Ruby-side callers. Invisible to TypeScript-conformant callers (non-nullable TS type). Temporary by design — to be removed when BRC-100 settles change-pool visibility upstream.
- *2026-06-25* — HLR #428 landed: BRC-100 basket-name validation at both layers. `BSV::Wallet::BRC100` now normalises (trim + lowercase + frozen) and rule-checks every basket-accepting entry point (`createAction`, `internalizeAction`, `listOutputs`, `relinquishOutput`) against the 8 BRC-100 §"Rules for Basket Names" rules; `baskets.name` carries 7 matching CHECK constraints (one per structural rule) so the principle-of-state floor rejects writes that bypass the conformance layer. The reserved-names table moved four basket rows (`admin`, `default`, `p `, ` basket`) from "Boundary-only" to "Implemented (boundary + DB)". `admin` reservation citation corrected — BRC-100, not BRC-99 (the latter only specifies `p `). The 300-character limit (TS-type-aligned over the spec prose's 400) landed in code; upstream `bitcoin-sv/BRCs` tracker filed. Same-family work for BRC-98 protocol IDs / labels / tags remains tracked separately.
